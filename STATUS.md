## Current Phase: 2 — Multi-tenant SaaS Layer

### ✅ Done

- **SaaS / Multi-tenancy Core & Security:**
  - Multi-tenant model layout: `Organization`, `OrganizationTier` (Bronze, Silver, Gold), and RBAC (`User`, `Role`, `Permission`).
  - Database schema migrated and seeded via `migrate_saas.py` mapping default single-tenant records to a `Default Org` and generating a tenant operator `admin@vcpilot.com`.
  - Scoped data queries by `organization_id` for all models (`Account`, `SystemConfig`, `Signal`, `Watchlist`, `Position`, `Trade`, `AuditLog`).
  - Scoped Celery tasks looping over active organizations to screen and trade using individual configuration sets and rules.
  - Read-only rule config page for Organisation Admins with custom rules thresholds loaded dynamically per organization tier.
  - **Multi-Tenant WhatsApp Integration**: Scoped the WhatsApp Admin status page (`/admin/whatsapp`), the WAHA sessions (`org_{org_id}`), and the command bot (`/webhook/whatsapp` and `AgentCommandHandler`) to the active tenant organization context. Hook messages automatically parse the target organization from the session name, retrieve configurations (enabled/JID admin number) per tenant, verify the sender, and execute isolated commands. Scoped background tasks like daily reports and regime updates notify all active organizations' configured admins.
  - **Super Admin Panel UI:** Manage organizations, create and bootstrap tenants, edit rules and overrides per tier, and manage global users and roles.
  - **Organization-Scoped Rules Customization:** Added `organization_id` column to `RuleConfig`, composite unique constraints, and automated defaults cloning on bootstrap. Organization Admins can customize rules (toggle enablement, update thresholds) with full database-level isolation.
  - Refactored `/login` supporting both `.env` configured Super Admin credentials and hashed database passwords for organization users.
  - **Email-based OTP Login:** Added digit-based OTP passcode generation, email notification templates, and fallback url debug parameters.
  - **Passwordless User & Tenant Bootstrap:** Password input is removed from creation screens. Auto-generates random dummy hashes.
  - **Password Reset Flow:** Implemented reset token generation, setup links, and manual copy-link container fallbacks.
  - **Global Users Filters:** Refactored users panel with inline search and tenant organization dropdown menus.
  - **Active Tenant Switcher:** Enabled context switching for Super Admins in the header top bar, granting them full view/edit privileges scoped to the selected organization.
  - **Branding updates:** Modern SVG branding logo and favicon integration.

- Full project scaffold (52 files)
- Docker Compose stack: database, redis, app, worker, beat, api, whatsapp, ibkr
- All SQLAlchemy models (account, config, market, signal, trade, audit)
- Minervini rule engine: trend template, VCP detector, fundamentals, market regime, exit rules
- 40+ RuleConfig rows seeded with Minervini defaults and thresholds
- FastAPI dashboard (replaced Streamlit): 4 trading pages + 4 admin pages
- Light/dark theme (CSS variables — Flowbite blue/white default)
- Worker status detection (online/starting/offline based on heartbeat age)
- Trading blocked automatically when worker offline
- Market regime trigger buttons (no longer stuck on "UNKNOWN")
- Watchlist auto-population explained in UI
- Audit log (append-only, all events)
- WhatsApp notifier (WAHA client — 6 typed alert methods)
- WhatsApp agent command handler (13 commands, ready to wire to webhook)
- IBKR broker wrapper (bracket orders, paper/live toggle, simulation fallback)
- Risk manager (position sizing, portfolio heat, pyramid rules)
- yfinance data fetcher (price, fundamentals, RS ratings, ASX calendar)
- Celery tasks: screening, trading, reporting, health check
- CLAUDE.md (agent context document)
- **Bug fixes (3 Jun 2026):**
  - Replaced all hardcoded Tailwind color classes (`bg-green-500`, `bg-yellow-400`, `bg-red-500`) in `base.html` sidebar and `health.html` status cards with CSS variable equivalents — was causing hardcoded bright green dots in light mode
  - Added `color-scheme` + `<select> option` CSS to `base.html` so native browser dropdowns respect the light/dark theme
  - Added `?msg=screen` flash message handler in both `base.html` and `signals.html` so screener button gives feedback
  - Fixed `/action/run-screener` in `main.py`: was calling `run_daily_screen.delay()` which has a `today_is_trading_day()` gate and silently does nothing on non-trading days; now calls `_run_screen_force` (bypasses gate) and redirects with `?msg=screen`
  - Fixed `/action/force-screen` to wrap `.delay()` in try/except so worker connectivity issues don't crash the route
  - Fixed extra stray `</div>` in `watchlist.html` that was prematurely closing the card and breaking layout
  - `health.html` was truncated at line 41 in bash sandbox (file system caching issue); confirmed complete via file tools (217 lines)
- **Bug fixes (3 Jun 2026 — Session 2):**
  - **Root cause of silent screener failure found and fixed:** `screening.py` had duplicate function definitions (`run_full_setup`, `_run_screen_force`, `_upsert_watchlist` all appeared twice) AND orphaned code outside any function at line ~429 — this caused a Python `SyntaxError` on import, which means the Celery worker could NOT load the `screening` module, so `_run_screen_force.delay()` silently queued a task that could never execute. File was rewritten clean.
  - **`main.py` duplicate route handlers removed:** Routes for `POST /admin/rules/{rule_id}/threshold`, `GET /admin/config`, `POST /admin/config/{config_id}/update`, and `GET /admin/audit` were all defined twice (exact copies). Removed all duplicates — file is now 648 lines (was 718).
  - Celery worker now starts with all 11 tasks registered and zero import errors. `_run_screen_force` is confirmed registered.
  - All `wsl docker compose` used as the command prefix (Docker not in Windows PATH).
  - **`admin/rules.html` Jinja2 `TypeError` fixed:** `sum(attribute='__len__')` on `dict.values()` doesn't work — replaced with `namespace` counter loop.
  - **`admin/rules.html` orphaned style block fixed:** `{% if loop.last %}style="..."{% endif %}` was rendering as literal text — moved into inline style using `{% if not loop.last %}border-bottom...{% endif %}`.
  - **`admin/config.html` `TypeError` fixed:** `cfg.value|length` crashes when `cfg.value` is `None` — added `(cfg.value or '')` guard. Also fixed border on last row using `loop.last` in inline style.
  - **New page: `/admin/tasks` — Live Task Log:** Auto-polling (every 3s) page that streams new audit events from the DB as tasks run. Shows data state counters (stocks, bars, signals, watchlist) that auto-update. Quick-trigger buttons to launch any task. All without a page reload. Added "Task Log · Live" nav entry in sidebar.

- **Bug fixes + improvements (3 Jun 2026 — Session 3):**
  - **Root cause of 20-stock universe identified:** Wikipedia returns HTTP 403 Forbidden to `pd.read_html()` (no User-Agent). Fixed `get_asx200_tickers()` to use `requests` with browser UA first, then pass HTML to `pd.read_html()`. Now fetches all 200 ASX200 constituents correctly.
  - **`_run_screen_force` completely rewritten:** Previous version only ran trend template and only added to watchlist (no signals, no fundamentals, no VCP). New version: (1) pre-fetches RS ratings for all stocks in batches, (2) runs full pipeline: trend template → fundamentals → VCP → signal, (3) writes a `SCREENER_TICKER` audit row per stock showing exactly which rules passed/failed and why (🟢 SIGNAL / 🔵 WATCHLIST / 🟡 FAIL fundamentals / 🔴 FAIL trend / ⚪ SKIP), visible in real-time on Task Log page.
  - **New `SCREENER_TICKER` audit action:** Added to `AuditAction` enum in Python and migrated the PostgreSQL `auditaction` enum via `ALTER TYPE`.
  - **Task Log page enhanced:** SCREENER_TICKER rows have shaded background and emoji-based colour coding so you can immediately see what happened to each stock as the screener runs.

1. **WhatsApp integration fixed (3 Jun 2026 — Session 3 cont.):**
  - **Root cause 1 — wrong session name:** `WAHA_SESSION=vcpilot` → WAHA Core only supports `"default"`. Fixed in `.env` and `config.py`.
  - **Root cause 2 — wrong JID format:** `@s.whatsapp.net` → correct format is `@c.us`. Fixed for `61450325233@c.us`.
  - **Root cause 3 — webhook never wired:** `POST /webhook/whatsapp` route built — WAHA posts here for every incoming message → validates sender → dispatches to `AgentCommandHandler` → replies via `notifier.send()`.
  - **Root cause 4 — session never auto-started:** Added `WHATSAPP_START_SESSION=default` and `WHATSAPP_HOOK_URL/EVENTS` to `docker-compose.yml` so WAHA auto-starts and auto-configures the webhook on boot.
  - **Root cause 5 — QR code display error:** WAHA API `/api/{session}/auth/qr` returns raw PNG bytes. Modified `get_qr()` method in `whatsapp.py` to check response header/content and convert raw image bytes to a base64 encoded string, resolving "QR not available yet" issue on `/admin/whatsapp`.
  - **New page `/admin/whatsapp`:** Session status, QR code display, setup checklist, send-test button, recent command history. Added "WhatsApp" nav entry in sidebar.
  - **`WhatsAppNotifier` enhanced:** Added `ensure_session()`, `get_qr()`, `get_session_status()` methods. Auto-derives JID from phone number. Better error logging.
  - **Admin phone configured:** `+61450325233` → `61450325233@c.us`
  - **Status:** Fully functional, waiting for user QR code scan.

### 🔄 In Progress / Next Steps

1. **Scan WhatsApp QR Code** — Go to `/admin/whatsapp` in the VCPilot dashboard. You will now see the QR code image. Scan it with your phone using WhatsApp → Linked Devices. Once scanned, the status will show **Connected** and the checklist will turn green.
   
2. **Send Test Message** — Click the **Send Test Message** button on `/admin/whatsapp` or message `HELP` to VCPilot from your WhatsApp number to verify the bot answers.

3. **Run first full screen** — Go to `/admin/health` → "Run Full Setup" to fetch the ASX200 universe, download price history, evaluate market regime, and run the screener. This will populate your Signals and Watchlist tabs. You can monitor progress on the **Task Log · Live** page.

4. **Connect IBKR Gateway** — Paper account setup needed:
   - Configure IBKR username, password, and account number on `/admin/config` in the dashboard
   - Ensure `IBKR_USERNAME` and `IBKR_PASSWORD` in `.env` are also set for initial Docker Compose gateway boot, then run: `wsl docker compose --profile trading up ibkr -d`
   - Verify connection on `/admin/health` page

5. **Delete old Streamlit files** (cosmetic):
   - Run `wsl bash -c "rm -rf dashboard/Home.py dashboard/pages/"`

### ❌ Not Built (Phase 2+)

- Backtest page (Vectorbt — stub at `/backtest`)
- Stop order modification via IBKR (`sync_stop_orders` is placeholder)
- Pyramid add-on order logic
- CGT report export (PDF or Excel)
- IBKR position reconciliation on startup
- Sector RS ranking (rule seeded but not implemented in screener)
- Intraday price feed (currently EOD only — entry checks use last close price)
